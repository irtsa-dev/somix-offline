## Usage
Depending on if you downloaded the source code directly or the executable, you will run **somix.pyw** or **somix.exe** respectively.
<br />
<br />
<br />
The program will display a screen, allowing you to see the **products**, **ingredients**, and the current **recipe** you have created. If you have no product selected, an error will display for you ("No Product has been selected") informing you that you must select a product as a base.
